## Data Type In Python
In Python, there are several built-in data types that you can use to store and manipulate different kinds of data. Here are some of the most commonly used data types in Python:
1.	String(str) <br>
Strings are used to represent text in Python. They are enclosed in either single (' ') or double (" ") quotes.

![string](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/74b0fdcd-5fe1-43b9-b641-c2024fbe6beb)

2.	Integer(int)<br>
Integers are used to represent whole numbers without decimal points.

![integer](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/4e661920-205b-49f0-b199-073003e770c4)


3.	Float(float)<br>
Floats are used to represent real numbers with decimal points.

![float](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/644372ac-5399-465d-aaa0-daa9b4641e11)


4.	Boolean(bool)<br>
Booleans represent one of two values: True or False. They are often used in conditional statements and to control program flow.

![boolean](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/19a8ad51-2a04-4d30-9fb8-168ff0bcd023)


5.	Complex(complex)<br>
Complex numbers are used to represent numbers in the form of a + bj, where a and b are real numbers, and j represents the square root of -1.

![complex](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/42021b94-e31d-42ed-97ab-ce0f6409fa21)


## The Sequence of Execution Based on Operator Precedence.
1.	The `len()` function is used to determine the number of elements in a list.

![len](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/998d1c11-f083-4e19-afad-1fdbc5d35b73)

2.	The `append()` method is used to add an element to the end of a list.

![append](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/9dc67f00-8253-4a51-ad2d-93f0e9cf3486)

3.	The `del` statement is used to remove an element from a list by its index.

![del](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/acd850b3-06e8-4836-9162-261b5d7898b3)

4.	The `extend()` method is used to append elements from another iterable to the end of a list.

![extend](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/6c56b63a-b696-4b14-a6ff-a9ee2f81c2d4)

5.	The `insert()` method is used to insert an element at a specified index in a list.

![insert](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/7c8495bd-a940-4995-9af1-fa0dead9d2f5)

6.	The `remove()` method is used to remove the first occurrence of a specific element from a list.

![remove](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/0f700130-a31a-44ac-9f99-9958f6520c33)

7.	The `pop()` method is used to remove and return an element from a list based on its index.

![pop](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/4416ae04-d5d3-4838-a258-7845848e3273)

8.	The `index()` method is used to find the index of the first occurrence of a specified element in a list.

![index](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/0ee92731-a207-4e67-8912-056dd17b7c97)

9.	The `count()` method is used to count the number of occurrences of a specified element in a list.

![count](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/90c704c5-bf30-4e4f-85c0-437f751a73d1)

10.	The `sort()` method is used to sort the elements of a list in ascending order.

![sort](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/492fb085-12af-4701-813c-4fdb0471a441)

11.	The `reverse()` method is used to reverse the order of elements in a list.

![reverse](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/fd1ed935-a4ed-4330-9260-d42351de2a5d)


## SELECT OPERATOR
### Union and Intersection
You can use set operators like union and intersection to combine or find common elements between sets.
Example:

![union intersection](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/91780baf-f221-4593-8644-675bc4fc3687)

### Dictionary
Dictionaries are used to store key-value pairs, allowing you to associate values with specific keys.

![dictionary](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/b3be8879-0e3b-4955-bbde-6a18c264d8d4)

## Conditional Expressions
Conditional expressions (ternary operators) allow you to assign values to variables based on a condition.
#### If
If only a statement is True will be executd, if it is false it will not. In python, the body of the if the indentation indicates statement, the body starts with an indentation and the first unindented line marks the end.

#### Else
The if...else statement evaluates test expression and will execute the body of id only when the test condition is true. if it is false it will not.

<img width="246" alt="else" src="https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/7d25b441-2a3b-4247-8492-3e0ea944fc58">

#### Elif
Elif is used in an if-elif-else statement to test multiple conditions sequentially.

![elif](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/6a4085d8-1d7e-4e2a-865d-51dba250bce4)

### For
The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., a list) and perform an action for each item.

![for](https://github.com/vinamaulina/Python-Guide-1/assets/114405502/00993009-51e1-42f0-9d0f-414ff003379b)

### Nested For Loop
You can use nested “for” loops to iterate over multiple sequences within each other.
